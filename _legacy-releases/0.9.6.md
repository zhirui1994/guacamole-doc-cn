The 0.9.6 release of Guacamole features [improved support for database-driven authentication](/doc/0.9.6/gug/jdbc-auth.html) - the MySQL authentication has been generalized, PostgreSQL authentication has been implemented on top of this, and performance of database queries has been improved across the board.

Recently-introduced memory issues in the RDP support have also been addressed. If you have noticed unusually-high memory usage by guacd, or unexpected disconnects during RDP connections, we highly recommend upgrading to 0.9.6.

Guacamole 0.9.6 also features a new [user menu](/doc/0.9.6/gug/using-guacamole.html#user-menu) and [session management](/doc/0.9.6/gug/administration.html#session-management). System administrators can log into Guacamole, view all currently-active connections, and kill them if desired.

Database performance and support for PostgreSQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MySQL authentication has been generalized into simply "database authentication" which supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL. Both database-specific authentication extensions are built off the same database-independent core, so adding support for other databases is now much easier. Please note that this has resulted in [changes to the installation and configuration process for MySQL authentication](/doc/0.9.6/gug/jdbc-auth.html). You will need to look over the new database authentication instructions before upgrading.

Part of this generalization effort was spent in overhauling the MySQL queries themselves, and modifying Guacamole to make as much use of batch requests as possible. Using Guacamole with larger databases of users and connections should now be *much* faster.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-988'>GUAC-988</a>] - Connections stuck as in-use
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1015'>GUAC-1015</a>] - MySQL queries too slow
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1089'>GUAC-1089</a>] - Cannot save connection groups despite permission to do so
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1103'>GUAC-1103</a>] - Implement PostgreSQL authentication

RDP memory fixes
---------------------------

It was discovered that RDP connections gradually leak memory over time and, in some cases, might unexpectedly disconnect due to a segmentation fault. These issues were caused by recent changes to Guacamole and have been fixed.

If you have been encountering problems with RDP connections since upgrading to 0.9.4 or later, please try upgrading to 0.9.6. These problems should now be resolved.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1090'>GUAC-1090</a>] - Segfault in RDP when new user profile is created
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1095'>GUAC-1095</a>] - RDP connections gradually leak bitmap memory

Session and password management
-----------------------------------------------------

If you log into Guacamole 0.9.6 as a system administrator, you will see a new option for [managing active sessions](/doc/0.9.6/gug/administration.html#session-management). This new interface allows administrators to view a table of all active connections, sort or filter that table, and kill connections as needed.

Normal users will now also have the ability to change their own passwords, and can access this option from within the [user menu](/doc/0.9.6/gug/using-guacamole.html#user-menu). The ability to change your own password is governed by permissions that were not previously granted by default, so if you want existing users to have this ability, you will need to grant these permissions by [running the provided upgrade SQL script](/doc/0.9.6/gug/jdbc-auth.html#jdbc-auth-mysql).

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-801'>GUAC-801</a>] - User password management
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-802'>GUAC-802</a>] - Enhanced session management

Cloning connections
-----------------------------

The ability to create a new connection pre-populated with the data associated of some other connection has been added in the form of a new "Clone" button. If you wish to create a new connection based largely on some other connection, and you have permission to create connections, you can now do so by clicking "Clone" while editing any connection.

Clicking "Clone" opens the connection creation screen and pre-populates all fields with the data of the cloned connection. The new connection will not exist until you click "Save".

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1078'>GUAC-1078</a>] - Add support for cloning existing connections 

IE10 bug fix
-----------------

Several users reported that recent releases no longer work on IE10, yet continue to work fine with IE11 and other browsers. This was due to a bug IE10's handling of certain CSS styles which resulted in the Guacamole display being hidden. The affected styles have been rewritten, and this problem should be resolved.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1052'>GUAC-1052</a>] - IE10 shows blackscreen
