The 0.9.2 release of Guacamole contains several general bug fixes and improvements. Both telnet and SSH now support wide characters, such as those used in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and the login process for telnet connections can now be automated. Connections via RDP and SSH should now be more stable, and the Guacamole source now builds properly on more platforms.

Wide character support
----------------------------------

Several languages use characters which are too wide to fit within the space used for individual characters by text terminals. The standard mechanism for dealing with this is to allow such characters to span across two columns, but older versions of Guacamole simply placed all characters within single columns. This caused wide characters to be clipped, with only the left half of the character being visible.

As of Guacamole 0.9.2, wide characters are fully supported, and text written in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean is readable.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-440'>GUAC-440</a>] -         Wide character support

Keyboard interactive authentication for SSH
---------------------------------------------------------------

Guacamole has supported password-based login for SSH for some time, but some SSH servers require instead the newer "keyboard interactive" authentication method. Guacamole 0.9.2 adds basic support for "keyboard interactive", transparently sending the password in response to the server's authentication prompt.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-493'>GUAC-493</a>] -         Add "keyboard-interactive" authentication method to SSH

Automated telnet login
---------------------------------

Telnet has no standard authentication mechanism; all authentication via telnet is interactive and implemented completely on the server. Authentication thus depends on responses to prompts which are sent in text form and intended to be human-readable.

Guacamole now supports automation of telnet login, using heuristics to detect the username and password prompts.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-763'>GUAC-763</a>] -         Add username regex to Telnet

Connection stability issues
----------------------------------------

Several bugs ranging from threadsafety issues to segfaults have been causing problems with connection stability. Known issues which could lead to failures to connect (or unexpected disconnects) for RDP and SSH have been fixed.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-645'>GUAC-645</a>] -         Segfault when using private-key authentication to the set top box
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-668'>GUAC-668</a>] -         Terminal lost after command "reset" with linux terminal
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-678'>GUAC-678</a>] -         Segfault when using SSH private key
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-750'>GUAC-750</a>] -         SSH client is not threadsafe
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-751'>GUAC-751</a>] -         Segfault error in RDP connection
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-754'>GUAC-754</a>] -         Frequent caching issues in new releases

Build failures
------------------

Newer compiler warnings, differences between Linux and FreeBSD, and API changes within FreeRDP have caused problems with building Guacamole from source. As of 0.9.2, Guacamole builds properly on FreeBSD and against the latest FreeRDP from git.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-707'>GUAC-707</a>] -         Add support for latest FreeRDP release (1.2.0-beta1)
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-712'>GUAC-712</a>] -         FreeBSD 9.2 Build fails with SSH support
* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-735'>GUAC-735</a>] -         Error making buffer.c/h from source

On-screen keyboard modifier behavior
------------------------------------------------------

A minor issue which cause the appearance of Ctrl/Alt/Shift on the on-screen keyboard to differ from their true state has been fixed.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-466'>GUAC-466</a>] -         Alternating left and right sticky modifier keys only cancels visual indicator, not behaviour.

WIP connection sharing
------------------------------------

A major focus of recent development has been adding support for connection sharing at the Guacamole protocol level. While this is not yet complete, we have implemented about half the core changes required. This has absolutely no effect on user experience for the moment (other than a new "connection ID" message appearing in the guacd logs), but is a milestone as far as internal progress is concerned.

Eventually, once this support is complete, multiple users will be able to share access to the same display simultaneously regardless of underlying protocol - even RDP and SSH.

* [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-739'>GUAC-739</a>] -         Tie logical Guacamole connections to unique IDs
