The 0.9.9 release of Guacamole features improved performance due to dynamic use
of JPEG and WebP, as well as greatly improved LDAP support. The Guacamole
interface overall is now all but completely searchable/filterable, with
"Filter" fields available on every connection and user list. This interface-wide
availability of filtering includes the home screen, all user and
connection lists within the administration interface, as well as the completely
new and unified connection history screen.

Everything is searchable
------------------------

Just about every list in the Guacamole interface is now searchable, including
the list of connections on the home screen, all connection and user lists in
the admin interface, and the new connection history screen.

Users with large numbers of connections (and administrators managing large
numbers of users and connections) can now narrow their view by entering search
terms into any of the "Filter" fields. There is no longer any need to hop back
and forth through dozens of pages to find that one connection within a haystack
of several hundred connections.

 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1193'>GUAC-1193</a>] - Centralize usage statistics
 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1406'>GUAC-1406</a>] - Allow connection and user lists to be filtered

Dynamic JPEG/WebP compression
-----------------------------

Previous releases of Guacamole encoded images purely using PNG compression.
This was very efficient for typical remote desktop use, but anything involving
fast moving or photographic imagery would tend to slow down.

Thanks to the contributions and collaboration of Frode Langelo of [Skytap](http://www.skytap.com/), Guacamole will
now select between PNG, JPEG, and WebP depending on how fast parts of your
screen are changing, the content of those areas, and which encodings are
supported by your browser.

 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-240'>GUAC-240</a>] - Implement streaming of JPEG images
 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1305'>GUAC-1305</a>] - Implement support for WebP encoded images

LDAP improvements
-----------------

Guacamole's LDAP support can now be used with more complex directory
hierarchies, such as those used by Active Directory. In addition to directly
deriving a user's DN using a base DN and username attribute, Guacamole can now
search for and discover a user's DN when given the necessary credentials to do
so. This allows users to be mapped even if their DNs do not contain usernames.

Encrypted LDAP can now also be used. Past releases supported only unencrypted
LDAP connections, but communication with LDAP servers using SSL/TLS or STARTTLS
is now fully supported.

 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1115'>GUAC-1115</a>] - Support complex LDAP organizational structures
 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1166'>GUAC-1166</a>] - Support for LDAP over SSL/TLS
 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1342'>GUAC-1342</a>] - Passthrough authentication not working for LDAP in 0.9.8

Run commands via SSH
--------------------

The equivalent of the `ssh` command's `-c` option has now been implemented
within Guacamole. By specifying a value for the `command` parameter of an SSH
connection (or by entering a value within the appropriate field in the admin
interface), the SSH connection will run the specified command instead of simply
invoking the default shell.

 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1038'>GUAC-1038</a>] - Add parameter for running command via SSH

Sound, printing, and file transfer fixed on Windows 2012
--------------------------------------------------------

Windows Server 2012 suffers from a bug which requires both RDPDR (drive
redirection or printing) and RDPSND (audio) to be loaded for either to work,
even if both are not actually needed. Past releases of Guacamole had a workaround
for this which automatically loaded RDPDR if audio was enabled, but this
workaround did not apply in the other direction. If audio was disabled,
printing and file transfer would mysteriously not work.

As of Guacamole 0.9.9, both RDPSND and RDPDR will always be loaded if either is
enabled. File transfer, printing, and sound should all work under Windows
Server 2012, regardless of which combination of those features is enabled.

 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1196'>GUAC-1196</a>] - RDPSND and RDPDR must be loaded together

Linking Docker images to non-Docker databases
---------------------------------------------

The Guacamole Docker images previously required 100% Docker everything when
it Came to deployment. Both the web application and guacd needed to be within
Docker, and the database backing the web application (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
needed to be within Docker as well.

While all Guacamole components (the web application and guacd) still need to be
within Docker if Docker is going to be used, the requirement that the database
be within Docker has been removed. The hostname and port of your database can
now be specified when creating the Guacamole Docker container. The database
does not need to be specified with a Docker link.

 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1291'>GUAC-1291</a>] - Allow linking with non-Docker MySQL/PostgreSQL databases

Guacamole API and protocol changes
----------------------------------

In preparation for supporting real-time hardware encoding of complex grapics,
the Guacamole protocol and JavaScript client have been extended to allow
streaming of arbitrary video codecs. Developers using the Guacamole API can
associate the JavaScript client with codec implementations which will then be
used to decode and render video streams.

The Guacamole extension API has also been updated, allowing extensions to
automatically invalidate users' sessions by throwing specific exceptions which
by their own nature imply that the user's current session is invalid. These
exceptions are automatically caught and handled within the Guacamole web
application, invalidating the user's session and displaying a login dialog.

 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1354'>GUAC-1354</a>] - Add real-time video streaming support to Guacamole protocol
 * [<a href='https://glyptodon.org/jira/browse/GUAC-1364'>GUAC-1364</a>] - Allow extensions to invalidate user sessions

fixes are included in 0.9.9, including additional translations, changes to
interface layout and behavior, and improved support for Microsoft Edge.
