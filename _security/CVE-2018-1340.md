title: Secure flag missing from session cookie
cve:   CVE-2018-1340
fixed: 1.0.0
---

Prior to 1.0.0, Apache Guacamole used a cookie for client-side storage of the
user's session token. This cookie lacked the "secure" flag, which could allow
an attacker eavesdropping on the network to intercept the user's session token
if unencrypted HTTP requests are made to the same domain.
