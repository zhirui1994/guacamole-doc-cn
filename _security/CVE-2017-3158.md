title: Buffer overflow in SSH/telnet terminal emulator
cve:   CVE-2017-3158
fixed: 0.9.11-incubating
---

A race condition in Guacamole's terminal emulator could allow writes of blocks
of printed data to overlap. Such overlapping writes could cause packet data to
be misread as the packet length, resulting in the remaining data being written
beyond the end of a statically-allocated buffer.
